Custom Le Mans Timing
http://github.com/hamilr2/lemans_timing

Copyright (c) 2012 Reilly Hamilton, reillyhamilton@gmail.com

A parser for JSON living timing data supplied by the ACO. Implements several
additional features, including the ability to highlight changes between timing
refreshes.

The script polls the ACO for JSON data and stores information on each car at
each timestamp. Upon first visit to index, a new entry is created in the user
table, which records the user's IP. Subsequent refreshes of the page compare the
most recent timestamp to the users' last seen timestamp. Any changes between
the timestamps are marked with either green/red showing gain/loss, or blue to
show other changes. If a user wishes to have multiple "sessions", or if
multiple users on the same IP wish to use the service, custom user names can
be specified using the url format index.php?u=USERNAME. USERNAME will be used
in the users table rather than the user's IP.

Initial Setup / Install:
1. Create a database and import the lemans.sql file to initialize the tables.
2. Edit include.php to have the relevant database information

Use:
1. Open a browser tab pointing to auto_update.php
2. Open a second tab pointing to index.php
3. Either manually refresh or enable auto refresh
4. Enjoy

Set up for 2013:
1. Verify that timing link is the same
2. Update arrays in include.php to have information on teams/cars/drivers/etc
3. Purge database of 2012 data
